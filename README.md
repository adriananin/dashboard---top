# Admin Dashboard

This is a web-based admin dashboard built using HTML and CSS, mainly using Flexbox and Grid for layout. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing and monitoring data for various tasks.

## Compatibility

This version of the Admin Dashboard is not fully responsive but will be in the future. It is designed to work on modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Future Development

In the future, I plan to make the Admin Dashboard fully responsive, so it can be easily used on a variety of devices. I also plan to add more features, such as user authentication and advanced data visualization tools.

## Credits

The Admin Dashboard was built by Adrian Anin using HTML and CSS, with inspiration from various online resources. Special thanks to The Odin Project for providing valuable insight and guidance during development.
